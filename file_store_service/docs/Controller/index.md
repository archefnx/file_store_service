## Summary
The code snippet is a method called `index` in the `FilesController` class. It retrieves a search query from the request and uses it to filter the `Files` model. The filtered files are then paginated and passed to the `files.index` view along with the search query.

## Example Usage
```php
// Request with search query
$request = new Request(['search' => 'example']);

// Call the index method
$controller = new FilesController();
$response = $controller->index($request);

// Expected output: View with paginated files and search query
```
